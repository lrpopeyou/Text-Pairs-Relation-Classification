# Deep Learning for Text Pairs Relation Classification

This project is used by my bachelor graduation project, and it is also a study of TensorFlow, Deep Learning(CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.).

The main objective of the project is to determine whether the two sentences are similar in sentence meaning (binary classification problems) by the two given sentences based on Neural Networks (Fasttext, CNN, LSTM, etc.).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.8 +
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Data

Research data may attract copyright protection under China law. Thus, there is only code.

实验数据属于实验室与某公司的合作项目，涉及商业机密，在此不予提供，还望谅解。

## Innovation

### Data part
1. Make the data support **Chinese** and English.(Which use `jieba` seems easy)
2. Can use **your own pre-trained word vectors**.(Which use `gensim` seems easy)
3. Add embedding visualization based on the **tensorboard**.

### Model part
1. Deign **two subnetworks** to solve the task --- Text Pairs Similarity Classification.
2. Add the correct **L2 loss** calculation operation.
3. Add **gradients clip** operation to prevent gradient explosion.
4. Add **learning rate decay** with exponential decay.
5. Add a new **Highway Layer**.(Which is useful based on the performance)
6. Add **Batch Normalization Layer**.
7. Add several performance measures(especially the **AUC**) since the data is imbalanced.

### Code part
1. Can choose to **train** the model directly or **restore** the model from checkpoint in `train.py`.  
2. Add `test.py`, the **model test code**,  it can show the predict value of label of the data in Testset when create the final prediction file.
3. Add other useful data preprocess functions in `data_helpers.py`.
4. Use `logging` for helping recording the whole info(including parameters display, model training info, etc.).

## Data Preprocessing

Depends on what your data and task are.

### Text Segment

You can use `jieba` package if you are going to deal with the chinese text data.

### Pre-trained Word Vectors

- Use `gensim` package to pre-train data.
- Use `glove` tools to pre-train data.
- Even can use a **fasttext** network to pre-train data.
